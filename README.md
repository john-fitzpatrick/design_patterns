Purpose
=======

The purpose of this project is to explore the implementation of the material in Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, et al.

The patterns in the book are illustrated in Strongly Typed classes. I'd like to explore what those patterns mean in a more dynamic language like Ruby.
